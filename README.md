I am a PhD student at the [Insitute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [Professor Chris Bakal](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-chris-bakal), I am exploring multimodal computer vision techniques to better understand cancer biology. My PhD is part of the NIHR BRC [Studentship](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/academic-career-development/current-opportunities/phd-studentships-2023/) award.
